# Introduction to HTML + CSS + JS

This workshop covers the basics of web development using HTML, CSS and Javascript. We will start with an overview of each of these tools, then discuss how to get started developing websites using these tools, and finally we will discuss a simple example website that illustrates how these tools work together.  No prior knowledge is required, though some level of background in coding may be beneficial.
